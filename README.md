# gitea-stargazers-hidden

**Gitea** `1.27.3` - Gitea

Limited and private users are supposed to vanish from anonymous viewers. [`GetInfo`](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/v1.27.3/routers/api/v1/user/user.go) already 404s them. Follower lists already apply `isUserVisibleToViewerCond` in SQL. [`GetStargazers`](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/v1.27.3/models/repo/star.go) is a join on `star` with no visibility filter. [`ListStargazers`](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/v1.27.3/routers/api/v1/repo/star.go) then `convert.ToUser`s the lot. [`ListSubscribers`](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/v1.27.3/routers/api/v1/repo/subscriber.go) is the same shape for watchers.

**Without logging in, a public repo's stargazers JSON names users that `GET /users/{name}` hides.**

## What an attacker can do

Without logging in, read a public repo's stargazers and watchers and **learn usernames that `GET /users/{name}` hides**. That is recon on limited and private accounts that starred or watched something public: people who set visibility so they would not show up in search, then clicked star anyway.

It is a username, not an email, not a private-git read, not RCE. Combined with the [Follow 204 vs 404](https://github.com/abraxas/gitea-follow-existence) oracle, you can confirm a hidden login exists even when the profile 404s.

## How I found it

Visibility was a theme of the 1.27.3 GHSA wave. When a product 404s a profile on purpose, the next question is which list endpoints still join `user` without that condition. Stars and watchers do.

I planted `hidstar` as limited, starred and watched a public repo, and hit the instance with no token. Unauth `GET /api/v1/users/hidstar` is **404**. Unauth stargazers JSON includes `hidstar`. Unauth watchers include `hidstar`. Unauth followers HTML does not. The profile is shy. The star table is not.

Wrong turns already recorded: unauth `GET /users/hidstar` returning 200 (then visibility is off entirely - lab requires 404); followers HTML listing `hidstar` (that path already applies the condition); treating a 200 on `/stargazers` with only public names as SUCCESS; a reverse shell. Theatre. The leak is the limited login in the JSON.

## Lab

```bash
cd lab
./run.sh
```

Target **only** `http://127.0.0.1:18133`. Compose allows `public,limited,private` visibility and leaves stars on.

```text
unauth-user-get status=404
unauth-stargazers status=200 stargazer-names=['hidstar']
unauth-watchers leak=True
unauth-followers-web limited-in-html=False
SUCCESS GITEA-STARGAZERS-HIDDEN
```

## The fix

Apply `isUserVisibleToViewerCond` in `GetStargazers` / `GetRepoWatchers`. Unauth stargazers and watchers must omit `hidstar` the same way followers already do.
